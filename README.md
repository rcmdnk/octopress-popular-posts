# Octopress Popular Posts
## Based on Page View Count

This plugin will generate popular posts lists based on the page view count of
each post. See a [demo][demo] here.

To use this plugin, you'll have to install the [octopress-page-view][pv] plugin,
so that this plugin can get the page view counts number.

There is another similar plugin [here][pv2]. However, it's based on Google Page Rank.

Note:

This plugin needs
[google/google-api-ruby-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client)
version 0.9.

The previous version of 0.8.X doesn't have compatibility with 0.9.
