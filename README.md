# Octopress Popular Posts
## Based on Page View Count

This plugin will generate popular posts lists based on the page view count of
each post. See a [demo][demo] here.

To use this plugin, you'll have to install the [octopress-page-view][pv] plugin,
so that this plugin can get the page view counts number.

There is another similar plugin [here][pv2]. However, it's based on Google Page Rank.
